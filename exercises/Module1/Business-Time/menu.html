    <h5>What is a garbage plate?</h5>
    <p>The garbage plate is an example of American extreme cuisine. It was born in Rochester, New York, at Nick Tahou Hots, a landmark restaurant famous for this classic regional specialty. The earliest version goes all the way back to 1918 when it was originally called "Hots and Potatoes." The regular customers called it by the nickname "Hots and Po-tots," and it was basically a plate piled high with fried potatoes, baked beans, hot dogs, onions, mustard, and a chili-like meat sauce.It wasn't until many years later that the dish was officially renamed the "Garbage Plate." The restaurant and bar had become very popular with Rochester's large community of college students, who upon seeing this huge plate of food, and not knowing what exactly it was called on the menu, would simply ask the waitresses, "can I get one of those plates with all the garbage on it?" The name stuck and the tradition has continued through the years.Today, this bizarre dish is a popular item all over the Rochester area and can be found at many local restaurants. In recent years, the cheeseburger has replaced the hot dog as the most popular type of garbage plate. Custom dictates you get your choice of two base items, from a list that includes home fries, pasta salad, baked beans, mac and cheese, French fries, and other similar food items</p>
