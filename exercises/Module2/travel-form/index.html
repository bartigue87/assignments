<!-- You just started your own airline, and you need to create a 
form to collect data about your passengers' upcoming travel plans 
so they can book their flight.

You should collect the following information from the user:

First name (text input)
Last name (text input)
Age (number input)
Gender (radio buttons with 2 or more options)
Location they're traveling to (select box with at 
least 3 options. You're an airline that doesn't fly to many places...)
Whether they have any dietary restrictions (check boxes for vegetarian,
kosher, lactose free, etc. Include at least 3 options)
Each element of the form should be given a name attribute so you 
can access the data in JavaScript and do stuff with it.

There should also be a button at the end of the form to submit it. 
Upon pressing the button, an alert should pop up that looks like this: -->
